Want to use Liquid along with some plain old Ruby code?
First, of course, you need to tell Ruby about the Liquid library.
Assuming that you're in the @liquid@ directory, as cloned from GitHub,
just @require 'lib/liquid'@.

The big secret, however, is creating a @to_liquid@ method for any classes you want Liquid to access.

Let's say you have a Product class:

<pre>
class Product
  attr_accessor :name, :price

  def initialize(name,price)
    @name  = name
    @price = price
  end
end
</pre>

And you have a chunk of text that you want to Liquidize by inserting some details about your products:

<pre>
sentence = "I'm running to the store with {{ product.price }} dollars in my pocket "
sentence += "to buy a {{ product.name }}."
</pre>

And you create a product and parse the sentence:

<pre>
my_purchase = Product.new('box of sausages', 20)
puts Liquid::Template.parse(sentence).render('product' => my_purchase)
</pre>

You excitedly execute your code, expecting to see your beautiful new sentence, but instead you get:

<pre>
I'm running to the store with Liquid error:
undefined method `to_liquid' for #<Product:0x1388c08 ...
</pre>

@to_liquid@ ???
Where did that come from?
Turns out you need to add a method to your class that returns your instance variables as part of a hash.
(Liquid was built to be very paranoid about not letting people access something they're not supposed to,
so you need to explicitly let Liquid know how to access everything in your object.)
So, we update the @Product@ class description to include that method:

<pre>
class Product
  attr_accessor :name, :price

  def initialize(name, price)
    @name  = name
    @price = price
  end

  def to_liquid
    { "name"  => self.name,
      "price" => self.price }
  end
end
</pre>

Run that again and presto:

<pre>
I'm running to the store with 20 dollars in my pocket to buy a box of sausages.
</pre>

However, that's a bit verbose, so you may want to use @liquid_methods@, instead:

<pre>
class Product
  attr_accessor  :name, :price
  liquid_methods :name, :price

  def initialize(name, price)
    @name  = name
    @price = price
  end
end
</pre>
